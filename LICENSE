Remember the curse of the evil-doer upon whose blood the devil does drink and upon whose flesh the devil does feast. For eternity will the evil-doer bear this Sisyphean burden, only to be relieved of their suffering upon the apocalyptic end of it all including the foundations of the internet, computers, technology and mice. Only after the last AI enters the blue-screen-of-death modus, only then will the evil-doer be freed of their rightful and justified punishment for doing evil.
